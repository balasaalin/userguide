      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>Referencing a DITA topic, <term>map</term>, or binary resource (for example, image) that is
        located outside of the folder where the main <xref keyref="glossentry_ditamap"><term>DITA
            map</term></xref> is located leads to problems when publishing the content using the
        DITA Open Toolkit.</p>

      <title>Solution</title>
      <p>The DITA-OT does not handle it well when references are outside the directory where the
        published <term>DITA map</term> is found. By default, it does not even copy the referenced
        topics to the output directory. </p>
      <p>To solve this, you have the following options:<ol id="ol_mkn_r34_l3">
          <li>Create another <term>DITA map</term> that is located in a folder path above all
            referenced folders and reference from it the original <term>DITA map</term>. Then
            transform this <term>DITA map</term> instead.</li>
          <li>Edit the transformation scenario and in the <b>Parameters</b> tab edit the
              <uicontrol>fix.external.refs.com.oxygenxml</uicontrol> parameter. This parameter is
            used to specify whether or not the application tries to fix such references in a
            temporary files folder before the DITA Open Toolkit is invoked on the fixed references.
            The fix has no impact on your edited DITA content. The allowed values are "false" and
            "true". The default value is false.<note type="important">The
                <uicontrol>fix.external.refs.com.oxygenxml</uicontrol> parameter is only supported
              when the DITA OT transformation process is started from <ph keyref="product"
            />.</note></li>
