    <p>How you register to use a floating license will depend on how floating licenses are managed
      in your organization. </p>
    <ul id="ul_ehh_mkz_x4">
      <li>
        <p>If the machines that share the pool of floating licenses are on multiple network
          segments, someone in your company will need to <xref
            keyref="installation_setting-up-license-server">set up a license server</xref>. Consult
          that person to determine if they have set up a license server as a <xref
            href="request-floating-license-from-license-server.dita#request-floating-license-from-license-server"
            >TCP</xref> or <xref
            href="request-floating-license-from-license-servlet.dita#request-floating-license-from-license-servlet"
            >HTTP</xref> server as the registration process is different for each.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If all the machines sharing a pool of floating licenses are on the same network segment,
          you will register your licence the same way you <xref
            href="named-user-license-registration.dita#named-user-license-registration"
            >register a Named-User Licence</xref>. <ph keyref="product"/> will use your connection
          to a local area network, without additional notice, to automatically connect to other
          running instances of <ph keyref="product"/>. These connections may transmit your IP
          address to the local network.</p>
        <p>
          <note>[For System Administrators] Multiple running instances of <ph keyref="product"/>
            communicate with each other using UDP broadcast on the 59153 port, to the
            239.255.255.255 group.</note>
          <note type="warning">This mechanism was deprecated starting with version 17.0 and it is
            scheduled for removal in a future version. It is recommended to switch to the license
            server licensing mechanism.</note>
