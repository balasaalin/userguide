  <title>Guided DITA Authoring Solution Overview</title>
  <body>
    <p>We've had past blog posts about how Oxygen can be used to impose various editing behaviors
      for your team. In this blog post, we are going to try to bring all of these solutions together
      in a comprehensive overview.</p>

      <title>Migrating to DITA</title>
      <p>There are multiple reasons why you would want to migrate from unstructured content to
        structured: <xref

      <p>This older blog post details some possibilities of migrating Word documents to DITA: <xref

          format="html"
          >http://blog.oxygenxml.com/2016/05/how-to-migrate-from-word-to-dita.html</xref>. You also
        have ways to migrate from XML-based standards (like DocBook or XHTML to DITA) using a set of
        predefined transformation scenarios.</p>

      <title>Implementing Your own Style Guide</title>
      <p>Let's say you are a team of technical writers collaborating on a DITA-based project and
        suppose that you have your own various best practices in regards to which elements to use
        and when to use them. So, at some point you gather a set of HTML resources that explain how
        various DITA elements should be used, you store them on an internal server, and you want all
        your team members to have access to that set of HTML resources directly from Oxygen. This
        blog post provides more details and useful links to help you get started: <xref

      <title>Restricting the Visual Editing Experience</title>
      <p>The entire visual editing experience using the <b>Author</b> editing mode in Oxygen is
          <b>CSS</b> driven. Oxygen has support for defining various CSS layers that can be applied
        when editing DITA content. For example, if you choose to create a Lightweight DITA topic in
        Oxygen, it has a special editing layer that allows it to be edited with a combination of
        buttons, hints, and form controls.</p>

      <title>Imposing Business Rules and Structure Restrictions to the DITA Content</title>
      <p>In most cases, instead of relying on people to memorize numerous internal documentation
        style rules, you can convert many of these rules to Schematron and allow the application to
        automatically signal the content author when a rule is violated. You can also add quick
        fixes to show authors various ways to rectify the problem. This blog post contains more
        details about this: <xref

      <title>Running Batch Validation Checks on all of Your DITA Content</title>
      <p>The <b>Validate and Check For Completeness</b> tool available in the <b>DITA Maps
          Manager</b> view performs a lot of different consistency checks on all your DITA topics.
        It can also be used to apply <b>Schematron</b> business rules on all of your topics: <xref

      <title>Sharing DITA Editing Customizations with Your Team</title>
      <p>Most of the custom editing behaviors, toolbar, and menu buttons that are available when
        editing DITA content are defined in the <b>DITA</b> framework configuration. A framework
        configuration's general anatomy is described here: <xref
          href="http://blog.oxygenxml.com/2014/08/the-oxygen-sdk-part-2-frameworks.html"
          format="html"
          >http://blog.oxygenxml.com/2014/08/the-oxygen-sdk-part-2-frameworks.html</xref>.</p>
      <p>The framework configuration can be shared with all of your team members. For example, here
        is a way to restrict team members from using certain DITA elements: <xref
          href="http://blog.oxygenxml.com/2015/08/document-type-extension-sharing.html"
          format="html"
          >http://blog.oxygenxml.com/2015/08/document-type-extension-sharing.html</xref>.
        Furthermore, here is a way to distribute new DITA file templates to your team: <xref

      <title>Sharing Global Application Settings with Your Team</title>
      <p>Let's say you want all of your team members to enable the automatic spell checker when
        writing documentation, or you want all of them to use a custom term dictionary or a custom
        set of learned words. This older blog post offers some hints about how global Oxygen
        settings can be distributed to your team members: <xref

      <title>Collaboration, Content Management, and Version Tracking</title>
      <p>All major Component Management Systems (CMSs) have plugins that can be installed in Oxygen
        to provide access to the CMS: <xref
          href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/partners.html#cmssolutionpartners" format="html"
          >https://www.oxygenxml.com/partners.html#cmssolutionpartners</xref>. Even if you lack the
        funds to buy a commercial CMS, there are still plenty of open source version tracking
        solutions that allow collaboration for a single DITA project: <xref

          format="html"
          >http://blog.oxygenxml.com/2013/12/collaboration-teams-working-on-common.html</xref>. For
        example, the Oxygen User's Manual is written in <b>DITA</b> and we use a <b>GitHub</b>
        private repository to collaborate on it: <xref

      <title>Allowing Subject Matter Experts to Review Content</title>
      <p>Many technical writers are interested in having their content reviewed by the subject
        matter experts who are directly involved in building the tools. Oxygen has support for
        change tracking and adding comments directly in the edited content. Subject matter experts
        do not necessarily need to have the standalone version of Oxygen installed. The Oxygen Web
        Author is an online editing and reviewing solution that allows them to add comments and
        propose changes directly in the DITA content by using any device with a web browser (laptop,
        tablet, phone): <xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_web_author.html" format="html"

    <p>I hope this overview will help you to implement a complete guided authoring experience using
      Oxygen. As usual, if you have any questions or suggestions, they are welcome.</p>
